<p>
This
data set was collected by Gerhard van de Bunt, and is discussed extensively in
van de Bunt (1999) and van de Bunt, van Duijn, and Snijders (1999).
It is used as example in the manual and in
various methodological articles about <i>SIENA</i>.


<p><i>
<h3> Background</h3></i><p>
The data were collected among a group of university freshmen who, except for a few existing
relationships (acquaintances from a former school), did not know each other at the first
measurement (time=<i>t0</i>). The data were collected at 7 time points. The first four time points
are three weeks apart, whereas the last three time points are six weeks apart.
The original
group consisted of 49 students, but due to ‘university drop-outs’ and after deleting those
who did not fill in the questionnaire four or more times, a group was obtained of 32
students for whom almost complete data are available.
<p>

The students were asked to rate their relationships on a six point scale,
with response categories described as follows.

1. Best friendship
   </td>

Persons whom you would call your ‘real’ friends
   </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>
2. Friendship <br> &nbsp;
   </td>
   <td>
Persons with whom you have a good relationship, but whom you do not (yet) consider
a ‘real’ friend
   </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>
3. Friendly relationship <br> &nbsp;
   </td>
   <td>
Persons with whom you regularly have pleasant contact during classes. The contact
could grow into a friendship
   </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>
4. Neutral relationship <br> &nbsp;
   </td>
   <td>
Persons with whom you have not much in common. In case of an accidental meeting
the contact is good. The chance of it growing into a friendship is not large
   </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>
0. Unknown person
   </td>
   <td>
Persons whom you do not know
   </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>
5. Troubled relationship <br> &nbsp;
   </td>
   <td>
Persons with whom you can’t get on very well, and with whom you definitely do not
want to start a relationship. There is a certain risk of getting into a conflict
   </td>
 </tr>

Next to the sociometric data, available individual characteristics are
sex, education program, and smoking behavior.
Smoking was only allowed in special areas. As a consequence, the ‘smokers’ had
to separate themselves from the ‘non-smokers’ if they wished to smoke (which they often did
during coffee and lunch breaks). Thus, contact opportunities differed between actors because
of their smoking behavior. The education program was important because, although all
started to study at the same moment, there were three groups, following different courses.
During the first months all programs overlapped largely, but after a few months, the programs
diverged. Especially the 2-year program was quite different from the other two programs.
Therefore, this attribute also gives information on the individuals’ contact opportunities.

<h3> Coding </h3></i><p>
The digraph data files
are <code> vrnd32t0.dat</code> to <code> vrnd32t6.dat</code>.
The networks are coded as 0 = unknown, 1 = best friend, 2 = friend,
3 = friendly relation, 4 = neutral, 5 = troubled relation, 6 = item
non-response, 9 = actor non-response. Note that 6 and 9 are
missing data codes.
<p>
The actor attributes are in the file <code> vars.dat</code>. Variables
are, respectively, gender (1 = <i>F</i>, 2 = <i>M</i>), program (2-year, 3-year, 4-year),
and smoking
(1 = yes, 2 = no). See the references mentioned above for further
information about this network and the actor attributes.

<h3> Batch file operation </h3></i><p>
The zip file also contains example .in files and example batch files.
These can be used to try out working with Siena outside of Stocnet. 
One may proceed as follows.
<br>
Make a directory containing all files in vdBunt_data.zip and also containing
the most recent versions of Siena0*.exe (these can be obtained from the
downloads tab of the Siena homepage).
In particular, Siena01.exe, Siena03.exe , and Siena07.exe  are needed.
<br>
Execute first (double click) the batch file bunt23456_1.bat, 
then bunt23456_3.bat, then bunt23456_7.bat. 
This should produce a Siena session with an output file
using 5 waves of data.
