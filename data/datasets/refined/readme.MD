Here we created a refined version of the multi-level graphs. The difference between two consecutive layers are smaller. The node size order is 50, 100, 200, 500.

The code to generate these datasets is also available in "tree_size_reducer.py". We can mention two layers, and how many nodes we want to reduce from the bottom layer.
