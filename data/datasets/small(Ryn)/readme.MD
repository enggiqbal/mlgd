Here we have a small version of the lastfm graph.

The number of nodes are approximately 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160

We also have python file to read the graphs from dot file and print an array to use in our visualization code. To call this code run:

python3 print_javascript_data.py 1

Here 1 means we only considering one level. To take 2 or 3 levels you can call:

python3 print_javascript_data.py 2

python3 print_javascript_data.py 3
